### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've split my repositories between [GitHub](https://github.com/ffes) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ffes).

All my Notepad++ plugins are on GitHub

* [NppSnippets](https://github.com/ffes/nppsnippets)
* [IndentByFold](https://github.com/ffes/indentbyfold)
* [NppTags](https://github.com/ffes/npptags)
* [SelectQuotedText](https://github.com/ffes/selectquotedtext)
* [NppFileSettings](https://github.com/ffes/nppfilesettings)

My personal website and some other projects are on GitLab.

* [git-open](https://gitlab.com/ffes/git-open)
* [fesevur.com](https://gitlab.com/ffes/ffes.gitlab.io)
